# Python Bootcamp
This repository is made of annotations that I've been making from the Udemy course "Complete Python Bootcamp From Zero to Hero in Python".

Link to the course: https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-bootcamp/

* The annotations are made in Spanish (it's my main language) if you don't mind, you can complement it with my personal web, where you will find a detailed explanation of each part as well as other topics related to programming.
